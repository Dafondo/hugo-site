### The Gist
I worked with a team of four to make this game in 48 hours at Global Game Jam 2017. The theme of this event was "waves", which my group interpreted as the hand motion used to say goodbye.

### The Plot!
In this game, you are a highly decorated general waving guests out of your house after a wonderful and exciting soir√©e. Unfortunately, you live beside a busy multi-lane highway and all of your guests decided to park across the street. The party left them a little tipsy so they're at high risk for vehicular collision. The good news is that your guests have great respect for you as a friend and a general. When you wave at them, they stop in their tracks and wave back. Using your military experience and tactical prowess, you must guide them safely across the highway by waving at them.

### Features
The only control in this game is wiggling your cursor across the screen to wave at guests. There's also a camera mode that is meant to work with hand detection, but it requires high contrast between hand and background, so it doesn't work very well.

The default game mode is campaign which features a few preset levels designed by hand; these levels are all solvable. Survival mode is an endless high score mode that features randomly generated guests and obstacles.

### My Role
I was responsible for creating most of the artwork (to see all of the sprites please play survival mode). As the rules of the game jam strongly recommended the use of free software, I did all of my editing on [piskelapp.com] and [paint.net]. I wrote a small amount of JavaScript/HTML/CSS that handled animation of my sprite sheets.

## Challenges and Lessons
This was the first large project where I worked with a group of people (and people I had just met!). Working on a team taught me a few things. Firstly, I learned how to use (and how not to use) git; resolving merge conflicts, fixing buggy commits, and splitting tasks efficiently were all valuable experiences. Secondly, I realized the importance of specialization. Once my team was formed, we realized we had sufficient programming skill but lacked in other areas. As the least experienced coder, I soon decided to focus on art. This diversification of tasks really improved the process and the final result. It was easier for each person to focus on their specific tasks. Additionally, we could rely on each other to cover weak spots in our individual skill sets.

I don't claim to be an artist. This was actually the first project where I worked on graphic design. My teammates' support has definitely encouraged me to continue practicing and improving my art skills.
