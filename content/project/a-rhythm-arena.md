### The Gist
This game is meant to be a switch-accessible, rhythm-based arena fighter.
As part of a project for a digital humanities research class, the purpose of
this project is to provide an inclusive and exciting game for those with motor
disabilities. However, the game is not meant to be solely for the motor-impaired.
We want all people to be able to enjoy the game and hope to promote interaction
between them.
