### Wazzit?
This was a website where users would start with 1000 "meme bucks" with which they could buy and sell shares in memes. Users could make new memes and add them to the market at any time simply by typing them in.

### My Role
I worked on small parts of the frontend and UX, such as user portfolio display and buy/sell interface. I also worked on a D3 bubble graph visualizer for the market.

### The Future of Meme Trading
Brandon and Hastings have continued developing MemeTrades.com with entirely new backend and frontend. They've reached 1000 users at the time of this piece. Go check it out at [MemeTrades.com](New MemeTrades.com).
